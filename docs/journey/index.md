A Journey to Ghimo through Tutorials
=====================================

This section presents a series of tutorials designed to help readers understand
the key concepts behind Ghimo and how the framework addresses them. The initial
tutorials cover foundational topicsâ€”likely familiar to experienced robotics
professionals and researchers, but they serve an important purpose: to
progressively build the framework by identifying common problems, exploring
solutions, and generalizing them into a cohesive structure.

Even if you're already well-versed in these topics, I recommend following the
full journey. You can skim or skip the definitions and explanations you already
know, and focus on the parts specific to Ghimo.

#First steps
#-----------
#
#Checkerboard world (Ghimo internal simulator)
#  In this very first example, we have an agent that lives in a checkerboard world and it has to move from an initial position to a goal position.
#  The main aim of this very easy example is to have an overview of the Ghimo framework.
#
#  Checkerboard: random agent
#  Checkerboard: random agent with sensors
#  Checkerboard: agent with goal
#
#Planar omnidirectional vehicle, naive controller (Ghimo internal simulator)
#  In this example, the robot is free to move continuously in the environment: its goal is to reach a specific position in that environment.
#
#  Planar omnidirectional agent: random agent (brownian motion)
#  Planar omnidirectional agent: random agent with sensors
#  Planar omnidirectional agent: agent with goal
#
#First detour: cellular automata
#
#  Cellular automata: fireworks
#  Cellular automata: Escherichia Coli
#  Cellular automata: genetic algorithms
#
#Planar non-holonomic robot, FIXME Oriolo controller (Ghimo internal simulator)
#  The non-holonomic constraints model a robot that is not able to move sideways with respect to the direction of its wheels.
#  Cite Oriolo controller FIXME
#  Multi-robot with different parameters
#  NASA controller Pure Pursuit
#  Naive controller
#
#Planar non-holonomic robot, Dynamic Window Approach (Ghimo internal simulator)
#  Trajectory rollout
#
#Planar car-like robot, Probabilistic RoadMap (PRM) (Ghimo internal simulator)
#
#Planar car-like robot, Rapid-exploring Random Trees (RRT) (Ghimo internal simulator)
#
#Planar 3-links manipulator, RRT and variants (Ghimo internal simulator)
#
#Planar 4-links manipulator, RRT and variants (Ghimo internal simulator)
