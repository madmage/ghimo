# Ghimo

Ghimo is a framework for "**G**eneric **hi**erarchical robot **mo**tion":
                                                                                 
- it targets **wheeled robots**, **autonomous cars**, **aerial robots**, as well as **multi-joints manipulators** and **legged robots**
- it is both a **conceptual framework** and a **software library**               
- it encompasses topics related to robot motion, such as **planning**, **execution**, and **control**
- as a conceptual framework, it tries to put together and generalize many different methods, algorithms and frameworks currently used by the robotic community
- as a software library, it provides both C/C++ and Python APIs                  
                                                                                 
I started working on this framework during my Master thesis ([here, in Italian only](oldies/from-msc-thesis/tesi-pathplanning.pdf),
where I developed algorithms for the motion of wheeled robots) and my PhD thesis
([Mobile robots and vehicles motion systems: a unifying framework](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345310578_Mobile_robots_and_vehicles_motion_systems_a_unifying_framework),
where I started working on the generalization of the framework).
