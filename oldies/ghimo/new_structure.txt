state

action

model
- state, action -> new state
- state, action -> delta state

state-space structure creation
IN: state space description
OUT: state space description
- e.g. PRM
- real state -> state-space new structure -> real state

trajectory/plan generator
IN: current state / goal / state space description
OUT: trajectory / path
- best effort
- optimizer
- heuristics
- also unfeasible ones (violates constraints)
- constraints: obstacles / illegal states, allowed planning space
- objective function
- action -> new state (model)

online refinement
IN: trajectory / path
OUT: trajectory / path
- objective function
- optimizer
- update initial (current) state
- goal change
- constraints change (moving obstacles)
- can be replan from scratch

executor
IN: current state / trajectory / path / goal
OUT: action
- plan/trajectory to action
- constraints

controller
IN: current state / path / trajectory / goal
OUT: action
- filters the action given by the executor
- constraints
