Welcome to Ghimo's documentation!
=================================

Ghimo is a framework for "\[**G**\]eneric \[**hi**\]erarchical robot \[**mo**\]tion":

- it targets **wheeled robots**, **autonomous cars**, **aerial robots**, as well as **multi-joints manipulators** and **legged robots**
- it is both a **conceptual framework** and a **software library**
- it encompasses topics related to robot motion, such as **planning**, **execution**, and **control**
- as a conceptual framework, it tries to put together and generalize many different methods, algorithms and frameworks currently used by the robotic community
- as a software library, it provides both C/C++ and Python APIs

I started working on this framework during my Master thesis (where I developed algorithms for the motion of wheeled robots) and my PhD thesis
(`Mobile robots and vehicles motion systems: a unifying framework <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345310578_Mobile_robots_and_vehicles_motion_systems_a_unifying_framework>`_,  where I started working on the generalization of the framework). You can read about the full history of Ghimo in the TODO history page.
